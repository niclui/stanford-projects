Question Answering (QA), or the task of asking a model to answer a question correctly given a passage, is one of the most promising areas in NLP. However, state-of-the-art QA models tend to overfit to training data and do not generalize well to new domains, requiring additional training on domain-specific datasets to adapt. In this project, we aim to design a QA system that is robust to domain shifts and can perform well on out-of-domain (OOD) fewshot data.

We implement a variety of techniques that boost the robustness of a QA model trained with domain adversarial learning and evaluated on out-of-domain data, yielding a 16% increase in F1 score in development and 10% increase in test. We find that the following innovations boost model performance: 1) finetuning the model on augmented out-of-domain augmented data, 2) aggregating Wikipedia type datasets during adversarial training to simplify the domain discriminatorâ€™s task, and 3) supplementing the training data with synthetic QA pairs generated with roundtrip consistency. We also ensemble the best-performing models on each dataset and find that ensembling yields further performance increases.
